\usage{
\S4method{performanceIndicators}{Strategy}(object, of = c("portfolio",
  "assets"), from = NULL, until = NULL, which = NULL, alpha = 0.05,
  scaling.periods = NULL, include.weights = TRUE, include.costs = TRUE,
  use.backtest = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{Strategy}.}

\item{of}{Indicators to be calculated for assets separately or the portfolio.}

\item{from}{The date in character format \code{"yyyy-MM-dd"} or as date-object from which performance shall be considered. If \code{NULL}, no restriction is made.}

\item{until}{The date in character format \code{"yyyy-MM-dd"} or as date-object until which performance shall be considered. If \code{NULL}, no restriction is made.}

\item{which}{Names or number of assets that should be included in calculation.}

\item{alpha}{The significance level \eqn{\alpha} that is used for propability of cumulative loss at level \eqn{1-\alpha}.}

\item{scaling.periods}{Vector with annualization factors for calculation. Default is 252, 52, 12, 4, 1 for daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly data respectively.}

\item{include.weights}{Only relevant if \code{of="assets"}: If \code{FALSE}, weights are all set to \code{1}. This might be necessary if only single stock performance without weighting shall be considered.}

\item{include.costs}{If \code{FALSE}, the fixed and relative trading costs are NOT considered for performance calculation. Default value is \code{TRUE}. As default values for costs are \code{0}, this argument is redundant if no costs are given.}

\item{use.backtest}{If set to \code{TRUE}, the signals from the backtesting output are considered for maximum drawdown calculation. If \code{FALSE}, the signals from the initial strategy execution are used.}
