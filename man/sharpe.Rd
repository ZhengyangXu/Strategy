\title{Get Sharpe Ratio of Performance}
\usage{
sharpe(object, rf=0, of="portfolio"
     , which=NULL, from=NULL, until=NULL
     , scaling.periods=1, include.costs=T
     , use.backtest=F)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{Strategy}.}

\item{rf}{Risk free rate in decimal, e.g. \code{rf=0.01} equals \code{1 percent}.}

\item{of}{Sharpe ratio to be calculated for assets separately or the portfolio sharpe.}

\item{from}{The date in character format \code{"yyyy-MM-dd"} or as date-object from which performance shall be considered. If \code{NULL}, no restriction is made.}

\item{until}{The date in character format \code{"yyyy-MM-dd"} or as date-object until which performance shall be considered. If \code{NULL}, no restriction is made.}

\item{which}{Names or number of assets that should be included in calculation.}

\item{scaling.periods}{Vector with annualization factors for sharpe ratio calculation. E.g. if data is monthly, scaling.periods is to be set to 12 for the respective.}

\item{include.costs}{If \code{FALSE}, the fixed and relative trading costs are NOT considered for performance calculation. Default value is \code{TRUE}. As default values for costs are \code{0}, this argument is redundant if no costs are given.}

\item{use.backtest}{If \code{TRUE}, the performance of the backtesting output is considered for sharpe ratio calculation. If \code{FALSE}, the performance of the initial strategy execution are used.}
