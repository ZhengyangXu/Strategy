\usage{
hitratio(object, of="portfolio", type="per.signal"
     , which=NULL, from=NULL, until=NULL
     , include.costs=T, use.backtest=F)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{Strategy}.}

\item{of}{Hit Ratio to be calculated for assets separately or the portfolio (weighted hit ratios according to average asset weights).}

\item{from}{The date in character format \code{"yyyy-MM-dd"} or as date-object from which returns shall be considered. If \code{NULL}, no restriction is made.}

\item{until}{The date in character format \code{"yyyy-MM-dd"} or as date-object until which returns shall be considered. If \code{NULL}, no restriction is made.}

\item{which}{Names or number of assets that should be included in calculation.}

\item{type}{If the hitratio shall be calculated per trade with \code{per.trade} or per signal \code{per.signal}.}

\item{include.costs}{If \code{FALSE}, the fixed and relative trading costs are NOT considered for performance calculation. Default value is \code{TRUE}. As default values for costs are \code{0}, this argument is redundant if no costs are given.}

\item{use.backtest}{If set to \code{TRUE}, the signals from the backtesting output are considered for maximum drawdown calculation. If \code{FALSE}, the signals from the initial strategy execution are used.}
